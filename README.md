# Pong #
Simple Classic Pong game in C++. Created with a tutorial by NVitanovic on YouTube, changed to suit my personal preference and make it work with UNIX. 

## Contributions ##
Contributions for this project are desperately needed as it does not work properly since I could not use the libraries Windows users can to make the game work. If you would like to do so, look in the issues page, contact me, and thank you so much.
